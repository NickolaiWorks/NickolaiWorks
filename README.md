- 👋 Hi, I’m @NickolaiWorks, AKA Nico
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Software development and cybersecurity, mainly in Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... advanced Java, Python syntax, and will soon be moving on to C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm unsure so far. In the grand scheme of things, I don't know where my skills stand,
- so I'll be browsing the forums until I see something I feel capable of contributing to.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'll set up an email specifically for my coding adventures in the near future.
